# Pokedex


Project ![Screenshot 2024-10-24 152753](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9394281-cf20-4ae5-8a12-117a143614a2)

created for one's passion about Pokemon, a showcase website that displays Pokemon and creates your teams. The technologies used are `Vue Js` (with the `vue route` package), `SASS`, and to get such information, I used an `API` service `https://pokeapi.co/` to make these requests, I used `Axios`.

In the page, you can see that the Pokemon that will be displayed are 50. You can change the results page to view different Pokemon, and there's a search bar to filter Pokemon. There's also a dropdown menu that will show the teams, and a volume control for the music.

Sure, to view a single Pokemon, you need to click on the Pokemon, which will direct you to its dedicated page

As you can see, it shows the Pokemon's physiological data, its statistics, and its evolutions. By clicking the arrow next to the Pokemon, you can view the next Pokemon, and by clicking the arrow on the left, you can view the previous Pokemon.

You can catch a Pokemon by clicking on the 'Catch' button, which will display a modal where you need to enter a new name or a team you've already created. The maximum number of teams you can have is 6, and you cannot add the same Pokemon to the same team.

To view your team, simply return to the home page and click on the button next to the search bar, which will display a menu. Clicking on 'Team' will show you a list of your teams. Clicking on one of them will take you to the page of your team.

On this page, you can delete your team, a single Pokémon, or click on a Pokémon to view its details.
